What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    I think overall we first tried to think more conceptually of the different classes we would need and how they would have to interact with each other. Then we started to think about what specific methods each class would need and how that would be incorporated into the Game Loop.

What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    One thing I figured out while completing the project was that it's a little more complicated than I first thought to have an ArrayList where you're referencing other parts of the ArrayList. We had a grid setup for our rooms, but we had to set the rooms next to each other as null at first and then implement a function to modify each room to be able to move between rooms. Also I think the conceptual aspect of having to think about what different classes are necessary to build a game from scratch was definitely a learning curve.

Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    I think maybe it would have been nice to streamline GameLoop and have more of our conditionals inside each class. The nested if/else statements still got the job done, but maybe our code would be cleaner and easier to read if everything wasn't so nested. Also, I do like the way we set up our rooms as grids, but it would have been interesting to play around with graphs for our map.

If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    I would definitely add more challenges and objects to pick up besides just the keys. During our original brainstorm phase, we were hoping to include like power-ups and special abilities. We even wanted to include other characters within the game the player had to avoid to stay alive. Adding in being able to pick up special abilities and have other characters to interact with would have been awesome. Also, we do have alternate endings, but adding more ways to die or addings more keys with trickier hiding spots would be cool. 

What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    We went to Jordan's office hours on a Friday and that was really really helpful. He helped us get a better grasp of how we should construct our rooms in our map and how we had to create a function to modify our ArrayList to be able to move between rooms. 

If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    I think I was mostly just really overwhelmed at the idea of having to create a whole game from scratch, but I would tell myself to just push through it. Definitely office hours was very helpful, and maybe it would have been even better if we had gone earlier. Also, it's okay to code something one way and realize it's not working and then fix it. It's okay if the first attempt isn't even close to what the final product ends up looking like.

_If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project
    I worked with Hanna Wheeler who is my dear friend and also my roommate. Seeing as we live together, we already had a good grasp on each other's routine and habits, so we were able to coordinate working together on this project really well. We did basically all of our coding together, so we were able to talk through every line in real time, which I think was really helpful in terms of keeping us both on the same page about what we were trying to do. I think the team dynamics only positively impacted my experience working on this project.
